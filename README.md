# The Trivia Game
The game consists of multiple rounds. In each round players are presented a question, a choice of answers, and have to select one answer within the allotted time (30 seconds or so). Players that chose a correct answer advance to the next round. Those who chose the wrong answers are eliminated. The game continues until thereâ€™s only one winner left.

This game is deployed at https://the-trivia-game.herokuapp.com
